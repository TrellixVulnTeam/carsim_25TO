carsim Simulator
===============

carsim is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. carsim has
been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and
validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code
and protocols, carsim provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,
vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The
simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and
environmental conditions.
